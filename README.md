# INFOTable Viewer

Simple static page that reads an Excel workbook and displays the sheet named `INFOTable` as an HTML table.

Place `INFOTable.xlsx` in the project root and serve the folder using any static file server:

```bash
npx serve .
```

Open the served URL and the table contents will be rendered in the browser.
